# Leaderboards
Pokemon Leaderboard scrapper

Sorry for the json by hand, this is one of my oldest projects :)

This is now the hardest/worst to maintain since Pok√©mon try to stop scraping.

Nothing much to say about this one.

It scraps the leaderboards (VGC/TCG/All regions/All divisions) to gather an history of players progressions.

Must nowadays use selenium and undetected chrome while only requests was enough not so long ago.
Can't run it on a RaspberryPi anymore.
